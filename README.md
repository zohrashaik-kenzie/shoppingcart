This is a Maven project which differs slightly from the gradle project you are used to but not by much. I am using Maven here so that you get introduced to using Maven which is very widely used (almost every place I have worked, I have used Maven).
It shouldn't matter what build tool we use as long as we get a succesful build.

To use this code, download it on your local machine.
Open the Project in IntelliJ. It will automatically discover that this a maven project and will do the required adjustments.
You can run the tests as normal
